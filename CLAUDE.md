# Architecture

This project uses C3 docs in `.c3/`.
For architecture questions, changes, audits, file context -> `/c3`.
Operations: query, audit, change, ref, sweep.
File lookup: `c3x lookup <file-or-glob>` maps files/directories to components + refs.

# Pull Requests

This is a fork. `origin` = `cuongtranba/kanna` (mine), `upstream` = `jakemor/kanna`.
PRs MUST target `cuongtranba/kanna`, never `jakemor/kanna`.
`gh repo set-default cuongtranba/kanna` is set; always pass `--repo cuongtranba/kanna`
or `--base main --head <branch>` to `gh pr create` to make the target explicit.

# Lint

`bun run lint` runs ESLint on `src/` with `--max-warnings=15`. CI runs it
before tests; merges blocked on lint errors AND on any warning count above
the cap. The cap is a ratchet: when warnings drop, lower the cap in the
same PR so they cannot creep back up. Plugin `react-hooks` (set 7+) enforces
React 19 rules: `rules-of-hooks`, `purity`, `globals` are errors;
`set-state-in-effect`, `refs`, `immutability`, `preserve-manual-memoization`,
`exhaustive-deps` are warnings.

# Render-loop regression checks

When introducing a new `use*Store` selector or any React hook that derives
collections, the selector MUST return a stable reference. Inline `?? []` or
`?? {}` produces fresh refs each call and triggers React error #185
(`Maximum update depth exceeded`). Pattern to use:

```ts
const EMPTY: Subagent[] = []
useStore((state) => state.list ?? EMPTY)
// or
useStore(useShallow((state) => state.list ?? []))
```

Tests can mount a component with effects and assert no loop warnings via
`renderForLoopCheck` in `src/client/lib/testing/`.

# Tests

`bun test` MUST pass locally before any push or PR. CI (`.github/workflows/test.yml`)
runs `bun test` on every push to `main` and every PR; merges are blocked on failure.
Run `bun test src/server/<file>.test.ts` for fast iteration on a single suite.
When a test spawns `git` or other subprocesses, ensure the spawn sets
`stdin: "ignore"` and `GIT_TERMINAL_PROMPT=0` so a hung credential prompt
cannot exhaust the test timeout. Also give it an explicit timeout
(`test(name, fn, 30_000)`) — the 5s Bun default is too tight for CI runners.
