# Decompose Large Files — Loop Progress

Autonomous refactor: split the 5 largest source files below 600 LOC each,
keeping every gate green. One meaningful extraction per iteration.

## Goal
All 5 target files (src/server/ws-router.ts, src/server/agent.ts, src/server/event-store.ts, src/server/diff-store.ts, src/shared/types.ts) are each under 600 LOC AND lint, typecheck, the full test suite, and c3 check all pass.

## Verify command
```
bash scripts/verify-decomp.sh
```

## Progress (latest first)

- 2026-07-16 Extract settings/subagent/MCP/LLM/skills command handlers to ws-router-settings.ts (testOAuthToken, resolveMcpTestBearer, runMcpAutoTest, handleSettingsCommand — 23 command cases) + 7 tests. ws-router.ts: 2277 → 1992 LOC.
- 2026-07-16 Extract skill utilities to ws-router-skills.ts (assertSafeSkill*, parseInstalledSkillsLock, listInstalledSkills, searchSkills, buildInstall/UninstallSkillCommand, installSkill, uninstallSkill) + 14 tests. ws-router.ts: 2449 → 2277 LOC.

## Next chunk

ws-router.ts (2277 LOC): extract the diff/git command handlers (chat.refreshDiffs, chat.initGit, chat.getGitHubPublishInfo, chat.checkGitHubRepoAvailability, chat.publishToGitHub, chat.listBranches, chat.previewMergeBranch, chat.mergeBranch, chat.checkoutBranch, chat.syncBranch, chat.createBranch, chat.generateCommitMessage, chat.commitDiffs, chat.discardDiffFile, chat.ignoreDiffFile) into `src/server/ws-router-diff.ts`. These 15 handlers all delegate to `resolvedDiffStore` and follow an identical pattern. Create a `handleDiffCommand` function that accepts deps (resolvedDiffStore, resolveChatProject, send, broadcastSnapshots, PROTOCOL_VERSION) and a command union, returns true if handled. Add `ws-router-diff.test.ts`. Verify targeted lint/typecheck/test, commit, push, update this file.

## Worker rules (every subagent MUST follow)

1. You are on branch `refactor/decompose-large-files` in the main worktree. Do NOT switch branches. Commit here.
2. **C3 first**: before editing a file, run `c3x lookup <file>` (binary: `bash ~/.claude/skills/c3/bin/c3x.sh lookup <file>`) to load its component + refs. After editing, if you touched a component boundary / public contract, run `/c3 sweep` or author a `/c3 change` unit so `c3x check` stays green (it is part of the verify oracle).
3. **Extract, do not rewrite**: move cohesive chunks into new sibling modules with named exports. Preserve behavior exactly. Keep the original file as the public facade re-exporting/delegating where callers expect it.
4. **Side-effect seal**: any file doing IO must be `*.adapter.ts` or match an exempt glob. Never add `eslint-disable`.
5. **Strong typing**: named exports for every boundary type, no `any`.
6. **Colocated tests**: every new module gets a colocated `*.test.ts(x)`. Test only the files you created/changed (`bun test --conditions production src/path/new.test.ts`) — do NOT run the full suite (the loop's verify does that).
7. **Stable-ref selectors**: any new `use*Store` selector returns a stable ref (see CLAUDE.md render-loop rule).
8. Make ONE cohesive extraction, run the targeted checks, `git add` the specific files, commit with a clear message, then `git push origin refactor/decompose-large-files`.
9. Update this PROGRESS.md: append a line under `## Progress`, and rewrite `## Next chunk` to the next logical extraction. Then terminate.

## Chunk plan (high level — refine as you go)

- **ws-router.ts (2449)** → per-domain sub-routers: chat, diff, settings, workflows, orchestration, subagents, mcp, tool-callback. Each `ws-router-<domain>.ts` owns its command handlers; `ws-router.ts` becomes a thin dispatcher.
- **agent.ts (4998)** → sub-coordinators: claude-session-lifecycle, turn-orchestration, oauth-pool wiring, subagent-orchestration wiring, workflow-registration, loop+orchestration wiring, background-task keepalive, session-sweeper/idle-reaper. `AgentCoordinator` composes them.
- **event-store.ts (2537)** → split: core append/replay, snapshot fold, read-model derivations, orchestration-event application, subscriptions.
- **diff-store.ts (2251)** → split by concern (parsing/adapter IO vs domain read-model vs subscriptions).
- **shared/types.ts (2108)** → split by domain: chat/message types, provider+model catalog, settings types, subagent/orch types. Keep `types.ts` re-exporting for compat.
